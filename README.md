# r/RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial

I'm following [This tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/libtcod/1) instead of the original.  
This tutorial branches the original to Python 3.  
I write my code in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and commit all my project files through [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/).

Below is the information from the original tutorial repository page.
